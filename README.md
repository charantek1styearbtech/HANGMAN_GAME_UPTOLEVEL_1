## Requirements

Before setting up the Hangman Game project, ensure that you have the following installed on your local machine:

- Flutter SDK: [Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- Dart SDK: [Installation Guide](https://dart.dev/get-dart)

## Getting Started

To get started with the Hangman Game project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/charantek1styearbtech/HANGMAN_GAME_UPTOLEVEL_1.git
```

2. Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd HANGMAN_GAME_UPTOLEVEL_1
```

3. Fetch the dependencies:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

4. Run the application:

```bash
flutter run
```

Make sure you have an emulator or a physical device connected before running the application.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can start playing the Hangman Game. The rules are simple:

1. The game will randomly select a word from a pre-defined list.
2. You need to guess the letters of the word one by one.
3. If your guess is correct, the letter will be revealed in the word.
4. If your guess is incorrect, the hangman visual will progress.
5. Keep guessing the letters until you successfully guess the word or the hangman is complete.
6. You win the game if you guess the word correctly, and you lose if the hangman is complete.
